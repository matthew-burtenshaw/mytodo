# MyTodo Application
A simple and efficient todo list app built with **React Native, Expo, and WatermelonDB**.

### Note
This application has been developed on a Windows machine, and therefore the iOS application has not been worked on and will probably not work. This is something to work on.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended) → [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI** → Install globally
- **Java** (Min. Java 21) → for Android builds
- **Android Studio + Android SDK** → for Android Emulators and builds

## Running the app
### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matthew-burtenshaw/mytodo.git
cd mytodo
```

### 2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Prebuild the native code

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm start
```

### 5. Build the Android development build

```sh
npm run android
```
You should now have the MyTodo application running on your Android device - either an emulator or a plugged in device.

## Project Structure
The **MyTodo App** is organized into a modular structure, making it easy to maintain and scale.

### Key folders
- **`src/components`** → Contains UI components which can be used across multiple screens
-**`src/model`** → The code handling interaction with the WatermelonDB database, including the schema, database instance and model logic
-**`src/navigation`** → Handles the Navigation through the applications and the screens

---

- The **entry point** is `index.tsx` (from Expo).
- **Navigation** is handled in `src/navigation/`.
- **Todos are stored in a local database** using **WatermelonDB (`src/model/`)**.
- **Reusable UI components** live in `src/components/`.

---

## Technical Decisions & Assumptions
### **🛠️ Technology Choices**
The MyTodo app was built using the following technologies based on the assessment requirements:

- **React Native** → Chosen for cross-platform mobile development.
- **Expo (Managed Workflow)** → Simplifies development by handling native dependencies and builds.
- **WatermelonDB** → Provides efficient local database management with reactive data updates.
- **React Navigation** → Implements smooth screen transitions and modal navigation.
- **TypeScript** → Enhances code maintainability with strong typing.

---

### ** Key Technical Decisions**

#### ** Local-First Approach**
- The app **stores data locally** using WatermelonDB rather than relying on external APIs.
- It is optimized for **offline functionality**.

#### ** State Management via WatermelonDB Observables**
- WatermelonDB’s **`observe()`** method is used to **reactively update UI components** when Todos change.
- Avoids unnecessary re-fetching by leveraging **database subscriptions**.

#### ** Filtering & Sorting Strategy**
- Filtering is done **at the database level** using `Q.where()`, ensuring performance efficiency.
- Sorting by priority uses **WatermelonDB's `sortBy()`** instead of in-memory sorting.

#### ** Expo Dev Client for Native Dependencies**
- Since WatermelonDB **requires native code**, the app **uses Expo Dev Client** instead of Expo Go.

#### ** UI Enhancements**
- Smooth animations improve the user experience when marking todos as complete or deleting them.
- The app uses **React Native Reanimated** for performance-friendly animations.

---

### **📌 Assumptions Made**
- **User will run the app in Expo Dev Client** (not Expo Go).
- **The app will primarily be used on mobile devices** (not optimized for web).
- **Todos are stored locally only** (no cloud sync or authentication).
- **Users won’t have thousands of Todos**, so database performance is not stress-tested for high-scale usage.

---

## Future Enhancements
### Adding iOS + web applications
- Project created and developed on a Windows environment, iOS development not possible
- Adding in the iOS build process and testing it would be the number 1 priority moving forward with this project
- Increase the audience of the application - iOS users
- Further audience increase if web version - no need for application download, just use a web browser

### Cloud Sync & Multiple Device Support
- Integrate a back-end to the WatermelonDB to allow users to sync Todos across their devices
- Allows users to not lose their Todos if they switch devices or uninstall and reinstall the application.

### User Authentication
- Building on the Cloud Sync, allowing multi-user support, with many users who all have separate Todo lists.
- Look at supporting Google Sign-in or OAuth for ease of use.

### Adding Due-Dates & Recurring Todos
- Add in a due-date field to the Todo for items which are time sensitive.
- Create recurring frequency field on a Todo to have repeat tasks (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

### Push Notifications for Due Tasks
- Building upon adding due-dates, implement Push Notifications to let users know that a due Todo is coming up.
- Increases use of the app and keeps user up-to-date with important Todos

### Locaisation Support
- Tokenise strings inside of the app so that they can be translated.
- Allows localisation of the application.

### Adding in App Icons and Splash Screens
- Create a simple set of App Icons and Splash screens and add them into the application.
- Improve look-and-feel of applications.
